My home lab exists to help me learn crucial technologies that I'll need as a sysadmin, and as a hobbyist. Here I'll document what I am learning, as well as thoroughly document the set up of my home lab, for future reference.

As you can see, I'm not working with very much. It's a pretty old laptop, rescued from a school upgrading it's hardware. But it is more than sufficient for my purposes. [A critical reference that I'm using to set up my homelab](https://github.com/Yann39/self-hosted "Yann39/self-hosted"), used a mere Banana Pi M5 board, so I think I'm good. 

A note to anyone else intending on using an old laptop as a homelab/server: Many devices such as this have an option in the BIOS configuration, that will help preserve the battery on your device. On my device, x

Benefits:

- no desktop environment by default, saving my server much of it's limited resources
